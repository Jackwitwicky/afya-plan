    <string name="lorem_ipsum">Terms And Condition \n\ Afya-Plan is a platform that is designed to allow a group of women to come together in a chama where they contribute regularly after which they can get loans from the group to attend to their medical needs during pregnancy or the medical needs of their children.\n\ Upon approval of a loan request by members, the funds will be transferred directly to the hospital via their M-PESA paybill. This is so as to avoid any form of hard cash handling.\n\ Please understand that joining some chamas may require you to pay an initial fee as a registration while others may not necessarily require so. This fee amount is entirely controlled by the chama and not Afya-Plan. \n\ By ticking you accept to abide and follow the constitution of the chama you will be joining. Chamas will be strictly self-governed and never in any way will Afya-Plan interfere with their activities.</string>
